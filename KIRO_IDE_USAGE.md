# RoadWatch – Using Kiro IDE at HackXIOS

## Project Overview
RoadWatch is a validation‑first civic issue tracking system designed to ensure accurate, non‑duplicate, and GPS‑verified reporting of road issues using smartphones.  During the HackXIOS hackathon, **Kiro IDE** was used as the primary workspace for planning, documentation, workflow design, and assisted full‑stack development.

Rather than focusing on report volume, RoadWatch prioritizes **data quality**, ensuring that only meaningful and verifiable reports enter the system.

## Why Kiro IDE Was Used
Kiro IDE was chosen to accelerate development while maintaining structure and clarity across the project.

Key benefits:
- Faster iteration through context‑aware assistance
- Centralized planning, documentation, and coding
- Clear workflow and validation design aligned with hackathon goals

---

## Development Workflow with Kiro IDE

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture
Kiro IDE was used to:
- Define the problem and solution clearly
- Design system architecture
- Document validation‑first design principles
- Create hackathon‑ready explanations

Artifacts created:
- Architecture documentation
- Validation system documentation
- Workflow definitions

---

### Phase 2: Component Development
Kiro IDE assisted in:
- Structuring React components incrementally
- Refining UI for mobile‑first usage
- Maintaining consistent styling and component reuse

Key components:
- Landing and informational sections
- Reporting interface
- Map‑based visualization components

---

### Phase 3: Backend & Validation Logic
Kiro IDE helped structure:
- API routes for report submission
- Backend validation rules
- Radius‑based duplicate detection logic
- Error handling and response flows

---

## Validation‑First Design
RoadWatch enforces multiple validation layers:
- Image type and size checks
- Mandatory field validation
- GPS accuracy threshold enforcement
- Backend‑level duplicate prevention within a defined radius

These rules ensure reliability and prevent redundant or inaccurate reports.

---

## How Kiro IDE Added Value
- Assisted in translating ideas into structured workflows
- Helped document system behavior clearly
- Accelerated debugging and iteration
- Improved clarity for hackathon submission and demos

Kiro IDE functioned as a **development accelerator and documentation partner**, while all final logic and decisions were validated by the team.

---

## Outcome
Using Kiro IDE allowed the team to:
- Build a structured, validation‑driven system within hackathon time limits
- Maintain clean architecture and documentation
- Focus on solving the civic problem rather than boilerplate setup

---

## Conclusion
Kiro IDE played a critical role in accelerating planning, documentation, and implementation for RoadWatch.  By combining structured workflows with assisted development, the team was able to deliver a clear, credible, and hackathon‑ready civic tech solution.
